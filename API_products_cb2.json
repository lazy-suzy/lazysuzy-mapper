Crafted in a fusion of marble, wood and metal, this media console by VUUE spotlights the richness of natural materials. A cool slab of white Carrara-style marble with grey veining tops this statement storage piece, framed by the contrasting warmth of walnut veneer elevated on a framework of matte black iron. Precisely cut panels angle diagonally on the front four cabinet doors, creating an abstract chevron pattern of swirling grain and tones. Emphasizing the beauty of the wood, doors pull open via discreet grooved channels to reveal two adjustable shelves inside. Shelves stop just short of the back of the cabinet to feed cords through hidden cutouts with ease. Scaled slightly taller than our other consoles, this multifunctional design can hide clutter in the entry, store serveware in the dining room or display a flat screen in the living room.
