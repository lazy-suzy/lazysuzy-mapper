The disintegrated floral rug was designed exclusively for CB2 in collaboration with The Hill-Side. Brooklyn-based menswear designers, and brothers, Emil and Sandy Corsillo are known for high-quality workwear fabrics and patterns with a hint of heritage. Together with their unmistakable urban aesthetic, the duo creates a fresh vibe that's somehow both equally hip and timeless. Unlike much-coveted vintage counterparts, this rug looks way more expensive than it actually is. The creative process went like this: The Hill-Side guys took one of their favorite floral prints, blew it way up and layered on a cool halftone dot pattern. Next, master rug makers created a white base and using rich blue yarn, hand-knotted the floral pattern on top. Finally, the weave was scrubbed and distressed to reveal hints of the white base underneath. Similar to well-worn rugs dating back a hundred years or more. Tonal blues and luxurious pile rises to various heights adding to the vintage allure.
