Surprisingly versatile, the expertly balanced composition and choice of hues enable the rug to function both as a playful print and an at-a-distance solid. Each soft wool rug is hand-knotted with a Baloch weave, a time-honored technique that features a tightly packed, asymmetric knot. Finished at either end with short fringe, the yellow geometric rug enlivens bedrooms, living rooms and dens with its fun yet sophisticated flair.","PrimaryImage":"Suzette5x8RugSHS20","SecondaryImages":["https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/Suzette5x8RugSHS20\/$web_product_hero$\/191104150607\/suzette-yellow-geometric-rug.jpg","https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/Suzette5x8RugAVS20\/$web_product_hero$\/200520083633\/Suzette5x8RugAVS20.jpg","https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/Suzette5x8RugPileSHS20\/$web_product_hero$\/200520063658\/Suzette5x8RugPileSHS20.jpg"],"URL":"\/suzette-yellow-geometric-rug\/f95101","CurrentPrice":799,"RegularPrice":799,"Reviews":{"ReviewCount":2,"ReviewRating":5},"Dimentions":false,"Features":["Hand-knotted","100% wool","Rug pad recommended","To avoid damage to your rug, always vacuum with the beater bar off, using a high pile setting","For cleaning, we recommend using a professional experienced in cleaning fine rugs","Made in Pakistan"],"Variations":[{"SKU":442943,"ChoiceName":"5'x8'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":443065,"ChoiceName":"6'x9'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":443098,"ChoiceName":"8'x10'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":443112,"ChoiceName":"9'x12'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""}],"department":"rugs","catgeory":"all-rugs"},"SKU445627":{"CategoryId":1267,"familyID":95103,"SKU":445627,"Name":"Tresello Blue Indoor\/Outdoor Rug","Description":"Transform your outdoor dining or lounge area with Tresello, our durable and water-resistant rug with great living room style.

Based on a painted design by artist Kelly Ventura, the rug is hand-tufted with loop and cut-pile construction to create a high-low effect suggestive of brushstrokes. The rug's saturated blue, green and purple tones are applied through discharge printing, a process that uses special inks to replace the yarn's original hue with pigments for color that's more fully absorbed into the fiber. Made of rayon with a hint of wool for added durability, the rug exhibits a soft sheen and provides a wonderfully silky feel.","PrimaryImage":"Solange6x9RugSHS20","SecondaryImages":["https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/Solange6x9RugSHS20\/$web_product_hero$\/191126093407\/solange-rug.jpg","https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/Solange6x9RugPileSHS20\/$web_product_hero$\/200520075358\/Solange6x9RugPileSHS20.jpg","https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/Solange6x9RugAVS20\/$web_product_hero$\/200520080546\/Solange6x9RugAVS20.jpg"],"URL":"\/solange-rug\/f95100","CurrentPrice":499,"RegularPrice":499,"Reviews":{"ReviewCount":6,"ReviewRating":4.8333},"Dimentions":false,"Features":["Handtufted","Artwork by Kelly Ventura","Rayon and wool with cotton backing","Rug pad recommended","To avoid damage to your rug, always vacuum with the beater bar off, using a high pile setting","For cleaning, we recommend using a professional experienced in cleaning fine rugs","Made in India"],"Variations":[{"SKU":444135,"ChoiceName":"5'x8'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":444179,"ChoiceName":"6'x9'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":444202,"ChoiceName":"8'x10'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":444223,"ChoiceName":"9'x12'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""}],"department":"rugs","catgeory":"all-rugs"},"SKU444070":{"CategoryId":1267,"familyID":95090,"SKU":444070,"Name":"Siora Plush Wool Rug","Description":"Neutral yet hardly basic, our Siora rug indulges with a blend of wool and rayon that's made irresistibly soft with double washing.

Like a view into watery depths, the supersaturated, handcrafted rug spreads a foundation of deep-sea blue, balancing its classic, understated pattern and its modern, mesmerizing palette. Cozy underfoot, natural wool offers unparalleled durability, softness and warmth. The wool is hand-knotted, a prized, generations-old technique that wraps and knots yarn around each warp thread. The yarns are handcut and tamped by highly skilled artisans to create intricate designs and a durable, tightly constructed pile, resulting in a rug that's beautiful and easy to care for.","PrimaryImage":"JoletBlue6x9RugSHF19","SecondaryImages":["https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/JoletBlue6x9RugSHF19\/$web_product_hero$\/190618163418\/jolet-blue-rug.jpg","https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/Nellie99inLeatherSofaFFB19\/$web_product_hero$\/200520074310\/Nellie99inLeatherSofaFFB19.jpg","https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/CoslmaChannelTuftedChairFC20\/$web_product_hero$\/200520081641\/CoslmaChannelTuftedChairFC20.jpg","https:\/\/images.crateandbarrel.com\/is\/image\/Crate\/JoletBlue6x9RugPileSHF19\/$web_product_hero$\/200520075517\/JoletBlue6x9RugPileSHF19.jpg"],"URL":"\/jolet-blue-rug\/f92613","CurrentPrice":999,"RegularPrice":999,"Reviews":{"ReviewCount":0,"ReviewRating":0},"Dimentions":false,"Features":["Hand-knotted","100% wool","Rug pad recommended","Professional cleaning recommended","To avoid damage to your rug, always vacuum with the beater bar off, using a high-pile setting","Rotate periodically","Made in India"],"Variations":[{"SKU":393638,"ChoiceName":"5'x8'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":393108,"ChoiceName":"6'x9'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""},{"SKU":393191,"ChoiceName":"8'x10'","ColorImage":"","ColorImageZoom":""}],"department":"rugs","catgeory":"all-rugs"},"SKU302126":{"CategoryId":19231,"familyID":90551,"SKU":302126,"Name":"Handwoven Natural Rug","Description":"When it comes to adding a touch of elevated style to your home, this handwoven rug is a natural.
