The disintegrated floral rug was designed exclusively for CB2 in collaboration with The Hill-Side. Brooklyn-based menswear designers, and brothers, Emil and Sandy Corsillo are known for high-quality workwear fabrics and patterns with a hint of heritage. Together with their unmistakable urban aesthetic, the duo creates a fresh vibe that's somehow both equally hip and timeless. Unlike much-coveted vintage counterparts, this rug looks way more expensive than it actually is. The creative process went like this: The Hill-Side guys took one of their favorite floral prints, blew it way up and layered on a cool halftone dot pattern. Next, master rug makers created a white base and using rich blue yarn, hand-knotted the floral pattern on top. Finally, the weave was scrubbed and distressed to reveal hints of the white base underneath. Similar to well-worn rugs dating back a hundred years or more. Tonal blues and luxurious pile rises to various heights adding to the vintage allure.

Disintegrated grey floral rug was designed exclusively for CB2 in collaboration with The Hill-Side. Brooklyn-based menswear designers, and brothers, Emil and Sandy Corsillo known for high-quality workwear fabrics and patterns with a hint of heritage. Unlike a much-coveted vintage counterpart, this rug looks way more expensive than it actually is. In a very elaborate process, barely-there floral print starts as a white base handwoven on a traditional loom. Over-dyed grey yarn is hand-knotted on top then scrubbed down and further distressed to reveal hints of white, similar to well-worn rugs dating back a hundred years or more.
